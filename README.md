Data In Multiple Formats
========================

I'm frequently in need of data in various formats, so I created this repo to store the data I use most often in a few common formats.

Data here is all public domain, so please feel free to use any of it.

### Countries

* Wikipedia for country name, TLD, ISO codes and alternative spellings
* http://www.currency-iso.org/ for currency codes
* Alternative spellings and relevance are inspired by https://github.com/JamieAppleseed/selectToAutocomplete
* Region and subregion are taken from https://github.com/hexorx/countries
